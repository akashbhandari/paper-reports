# Autonomous Vehicle Implementation Predictions

[https://www.vtpi.org/avip.pdf](https://www.vtpi.org/avip.pdf)


## Abstract

1. Does a cost-benefit analysis of driverless vehicles.
2. Investigates how likely they are to be developed and deployed.
3. Analysis indicated more independent mobility for rich non-drivers may begin in the 2020s or 2030s, but most of the promised impacts, like infrastructure savings and independent mobility for low-income people, increased safety, energy conversation, and pollution reductions will only be significant probably in the 2040s or even 2050s.
4. Some benefits might only be reaped if humans are banned on certain roadways.

## Introduction

1. Most optimistic predictions are made by people with financial interests in the industry, or by people who base their experience on previous innovations like digital cameras, smartphones, or the Internet.
2. Such analysis often overlook significant obstacles and costs.
3. Many challenges before we have AVs that can operate autonomously in all conditions, and even after that, they must be rigorously tested, approved for general commercial sale, affordable to most travellers, and attractive to consumers.
4. Safety super critical, 100% safety >>>> 99.99% safety >>> 99% safety. 
5. Unlike most technologies, vehicles rely mostly on public infrastructure and impose external costs.
6. Vehicles can be programmed based on user preferences, or community goals. Policy makers need to decide how regulate autonomous driving. For example, is it beneficial to designate one single lane for AVs to allow platooning?

## Conclusions

1. Good reasons to be skeptical to recent announcements about AVs being available commercially in the near future. Most predictions are speculative and exaggerated.
2. Considerable uncertainty about their benefits, costs, travel impacts, deployment speed, and consumer demand.
3. Advocates often ignore big costs and risks and rebound effects, but double count benefits, for example, by summing increased safety, traffic speeds and facility savings.
4. The first decade or two, AVs will be costly and imperfect. They might not be able to operate in extreme weather conditions, unpaved roads, and mixed urban traffic.
5. The first decade or two, AVs will be purchased by rich non-drivers and people who frequently drive long distance. Other people won't consider the extra costs justified until late 2030s or 2040s.
6. During the 2020s and 2030s, self-driving taxi and "micro-transit" (van) services may become available in urban areas, and should be cheaper than human-operated taxis, but they will offer low service quality. The interiors will not be pleasing, occupants will be closely monitored by cameras, and passengers will likely find previous occupants' garbage, stains and odors. 
7. Critical question: Do AVs increase or reduce total vehicle travel and associated external costs? It will depend on public policies. For example, allowing non-drivers to travel will increase traffic, while vehicle sharing will reduce vehicle ownership and therefore total driving.
8. Most people will still prefer to own personal vehicles for prestige and convenience sake for a long time.
9. AVs' impacts on non-users is another concern. Would it be okay to reduce investments in public transit or impose restrictions on human-operated vehicles to make dedicated AV lanes. 
10. To minimize problems and maximize benefits, experts recommend that public policies encourage shared and electric AVs, and limit total vehicle traffic, particularly in denser urban areas. Can be done with High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) priority lanes which favors shared over single-occupancy vehicles on congested roads, increased fossil fuel taxes, etc.
11. In most of our professional lives, it will be more of a "paradigm shift" than a "game changer" to the degree that this technology supports shifts to more efficient and multi-modal transport planning.
